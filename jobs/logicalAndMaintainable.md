# Logical and maintainable
create simple, maintainable, reusable and easy to understand code

- how to structure methods and classes
- ensure logical separation of concerns is clear
- naming of variables, methods and classes
- it should work
- others should be able to read, evolve, investigate and debug the code

## Prepare
- get technical
- ready to write in real-time on an editor during interview
- gather qualifying requirements, translate them to code, check edge cases
- syntactically correct code, no pseudo code

# Best pracices
creteria and pro tips to writting good code

## simple code
leverage reuse, properly format, no improper coding constructs
- write examples of how the code will be used
- simplify complex code
- start with a working solution and optimize if time is left
- think of extendibility if requirements change

## maintainable code
quickly able to trace impact of changes, clear variable naming conventions
- method, parameter, variable names are clear and descriptive
- seperate funcionality into discrete methods/functions with clear responsibilities
- easy maintainable if traffic or load increases

## organize code
easy to read and understand
- functions and classes
- use inheritance to break up solution into logical components
- improve readability and make easy to extend

## syntactically correct code
correct or with minor improvements
- coding language most comfortable with
- comfortable with idioms and conventions
    - error/exception handling
    - managing resources(file IO, network connections etc)
- descriptive variable and method names
- if you forget a method call, tell it to the interviewer and ask if you can make up a name and arguments

## working code
create code that works as intended
- start small
- solve one thing at a time
- iterate over solution with questions and follow ups of inteviewer
- if you see design patterns or abstractions, apply them
- better refactor than to apply design pattern that doesn't solve the problem
- thinkg through test cases(working and breaking)
- think edge cases
- think boundary conditions(null/nil/none etc)
- enumerate cases before you begin coding to use for validation
- confirm test cases with interviewer
