# Problem solving
engage with your interviewer and ask clarifying questions

- interviewer will question your problem solving ability
- problem might be ambiguous
- plan your time to solve the problem in 3 tasks:
    - uncovering requirements and considering evolution of the situation
    - implementing a first pass of the desing and covering all requirements
    - enhancing the solution:
        - satisfy the original requirements
        - seek out more requirements
        - evolve solution when requirements change

## what is being assessed
- order:
    - take something complex
    - break it down
    - identify a solution
    - translate solution to working code
- ambiguity in the problem statement should be clarified by questions

## how to prapare:
- make sure you understand the problem and functionality
- then code it up
- test your ideas with examples and call assumptions
- ask interviewer if he agrees
- suggested:
    - solve problems without an ide
    - no ide during interview
    - correct syntax
- show how you deal with ambiguity
    - handle vague requirements
    - change strategies quickly if the approach doesn't work
    - work through open-ended questions
    - be adaptable and quick learning
- think out loud
    - do whiteboard challanges
    - talk while solving
- KISS principle, don't solve what is not to solve

# how to showcase problem-solving
what does a good response look like

## correctly solve
- edge cases and input that might cause your code to fail

## justify decisions
- identify tradeoffs and why one solution is better
- get at least one working solution, not optimal
- get it to work then make it efficient and scalable
- explain approach before coding and talk out loud
- try out different test inputs

## ask questions
- define the problem and clarify
- don't just start coding

## consider additional factors
- developer effort, team composition etc
- use best practices

## require minimal hints
- use hints to reach solution
- identify test cases and run them through your code
- ask for help with directed questions
- no trick questions or trick hints
- write hints down
